{- | A lens for operating on the ClaimPattern inside a SomeClaim.
 SomeClaim currently may not always contain a ClaimPattern. The
 current state of this lens is a temporary hack until we can
 refactor the SomeClaim structure to separate reachability claims
 and equational claims.
-}

{-
The 'Equational' case of this lens is by far the biggest problem with
getting equational claims to work properly.

There's been an assumption within the codebase that whenever we have
an instance 'Claim claim', we have (morally) that 'claim ~ ClaimPattern'.
This has generally been true, but it isn't a rule of the 'Claim' class and
'Equational' claims are _not_ represented by 'ClaimPattern's. Indeed,
'SomeClaim' is usually used directly instead of 'Claim claim', which is
a bad sign in terms of generality.

This lens is used all over the place. Simplification generally tries to
take apart reachability claims with this lens and apply functions to the
'ClaimPattern' directly. This bakes the assumption into places it shouldn't
be, such as 'Kore.Exec.simplifySomeClaim'. It's also ocassionally used
just to extract sort information, such as 'app/kore/exec/Main.koreProve'
(see line 803).

I've tried leaving this lens and adjusting the use sites to make everything
work without a major refactor but it became too pervasive. I also speculated
that it might be possible to use a partial 'EquationalClaim' <-> 'ClaimPattern'
conversion to trick the existing code into working, but it sounds brittle
and Ana and I decided against spending additional effort on that at this
time.

Thus, the refactor here will end up being fairly involved. The 'Claim' class
should get new functions for simplifying claims "using only mathcing logic
rules." Likely also useful would be functions for extracting sort information
from a claim, like @Claim claim => claim -> Sort@. To prevent similar information
leaks to the one that causes this problem, 'SomeClaim' should be replaced
with the existential
data SomeClaim where
    MkSomeClaim :: Claim claim => claim -> SomeClaim

Necessary information for reporting stuck claims back to the user (functionality
for displaying claims, mainly) should probably be added as a superclass on
'Claim' or as a secondary constraint in 'MkSomeClaim'.

With all of that, this lens should be able to be deleted entirely, replaced
by the generalized 'Claim' class and 'SomeClaim'.
